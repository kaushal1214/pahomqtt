Here, MQTT is implemented using C language. So there are many dependencies, goto the official Paho Eclipse for details.
The program is writting on the serial port, on which your board UART has been detacted (mine was /dev/ttyUSB0), so it requires root privelages.
Steps:
  1.Run a Broker (any mosquitto,hivemq...)
  2.Execute this C program in superuser mode
  3.You should be able to see, 'Ready..', if not then try to run the program again.
  4.Publish messages on a channel. (default one is 'Marvel')
  5.To turn on LED: Publish 'A'
  6.To get the Temp. value: Publish B
    Actually right now it will just return the ADC count for the current temp., I tried to convert it into celsius but that's giving a really big number. 
    So please help me with this here.
  7.To turn off the LEDs: Publish anything but 'A'
 Enjoy!!
