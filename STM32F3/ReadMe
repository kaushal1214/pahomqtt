Directory contains the code for UART on STM32F3
I'm using UART4: 
  Dedicated Pins for Transmission/Receiver are: 
  PC10 - Tx
  PC11 - Rx
The code that are sent over Serial transmission, has a dedicated function like-
  A: To Turn on all the LEDs (Port E, Pins 15-8)
  Off: To Turn them off (basically any command except 'A', will turn them off).
  B: To start the ADC and get the temp. value from Internal Temperature sensor provided in the kit.
